        description: |-
          You take two flights of stairs down until you finally step into a large circular room. The light around you percolates through the roof and you find it surprisingly well lit. As the clouds circle over the island the sunlight shifts and weaves on the floor in beautiful almost aquatic patterns.This room has four exits counting the stairs you came down. It splits off in three cardinal directions. In the center of the spherical room are engravings that run along the floor. Around the base of the staircase are circular bubble-like patterns, and as you touch the floor you notice the patterns glow incredibly dimly in the bright light of the first floor when you step near them. In addition to the glowing, you notice there is water flowing throughout. Some large like small streams others no more than a finger’s width wide. Wherever you step the channels and engravings pulse with a faint greenish-blue light.

          Lighting: Bright Direct

          You are right below the surface, the ceilings are low. The light is bright and tinted blueish- green. Most of the rooms have multiple entrances and exits, and the rooms themselves are more open in general.

            You are inside of a globe and its walls are a map. In five different large areas of what you can assume must symbolize oceans there is soft clay. Surrounded by continents that are made of stone. In the center of the room is a pedestal and sticking out of the center vertically is a rod made of driftwood with a coral tip. Beneath it, on the pedestal is a sentence written in the language of the gods. It says, “Hot to cold, and cold to hot; never stop, never stop; if they do, we all drop.”

            If the Heirs choose to investigate the room:
            Near the equator in each of the clay spaces there is a small hole in the clay constantly burbling warm water. Near the poles of this inverted globe are small holes in the clay burbling cold water. Three cold water springs are at the northern pole and three more are at the southern pole. There are six warm springs along the equator.

            Solution:
            If the Heirs push the rod into the soft clay near the spigot the water will follow the channel they create. The goal is to create six channels that circulate warm water to cold and vice-versa in a loop. If they do this the walls of clay melt down and reveal a chest. Roll on the Treasure table.

            You hear water rushing as you enter this room. A lot of the channels from this floor make their way here, either along the halls or through the small pipes in the walls. The water starts shallow around the edge and gradually gets deeper as you near the center of the spherical room.

            Heirs need to make a STR or DEX Save to stay on their feet at the end of each Combat and Exploration Turn. If they fail, they fall to the ground and begin getting pulled to the center of the room. While knocked prone they are pulled towards the center of the spherical room at the end of their Combat turn.

            At the beginning of a creature’s Combat turn, they may make a STR or DEX Save, if they succeed they are able to stand.

            If they fail two Saves in a row they reach the center of the circle. They are sucked into the channel at the bottom, take 1D6 Bludgeoning Damage, and are spit out into The Reef (generate a room in the Reef as usual).

          The Plunge in the Reef Depth always has one hallway besides the staircase to the Pelagic (where the players will have initially entered this level). The hallway South leads to the Great Barrier.

          The Reef is a shallow vibrant area, full of life. The area is known for the colorful blend of corals that dot its halls. Life here is beautiful, but much of it is toxic or venomous. Some creatures use the corals that they call home as protective armor. The passageways here are winding and cramped and dead ends are frequent.

          The Reef is a maze of stone-like protrusions that are made by small animal colonies. Toxic creatures and plants abound here. It’s easy to become lost when navigating these twisting halls, so only the most cautious of Heirs will succeed.

            This room is a curated glade of small coral and in its center sits a behemoth of a beast. A creature in the shape of a man but made of coral sits motionless. Where its head should be, a huge mass of brain coral rests. When you enter the room you feel something probing your thoughts.

            This room is a coral nursery and has one very pregnant Reef Golem within it. Due to this it operates a bit differently than most. It wants the Heirs to leave. If the Heirs won’t leave it goes from wary to agitated to angry to violent fairly quickly. It won’t allow anything to pass through here, especially if the Heirs are carrying any coral.

            This golem has +2 HD and the ability to force an Heir to make a contested INT or CHA Save in order to resist the telepathic probing of the Reef Golem. If they fail, they are compelled to leave the way they came.

            In the center of this room are five massive statues of heads. They are arranged like pips on the 5th side of a D6. The four surrounding ones mouth’s appear to be yelling but instead of noise, water pours forth. The water pours into a cistern surrounding the center head.

            If the Heirs choose to investigate, they hear faint words coming from the center statue. A STR Save with [--] can turn any of the statues. You can negate [-] by inserting a tool into one of the many holes that line the base of the statues.

            Once rotated, you can see that the center statue was also spewing water and you can clearly hear a gurgling voice (it’s speaking Piscine). Any Heir that speaks Piscine or any Heir that submerges their head in the cistern can understand it. The water level in the cistern also drops down to five feet, and reveals hand holds leading to the bottom.

            If a creature goes into the cistern, the algae on the hand holds glow at their touch and the light ripples down to the bottom of the cistern revealing an old locked (DEX Save [-]) chest with treasure inside (roll on the Treasure table).

            If an Heir submerges their head to get to the chest, they understand the words being spoken by the statue. It tells them that there is more treasure to be found and to look for “where the Father of Mountains mourns.”

            There are two huge channels embedded in the sides of this room. Water rushes up one and down the other. They look large enough to get inside.

            These channels can be used like elevators. One goes up and the other down. Creatures and detritus occasionally come into this room via the elevator channels. A creature needs to hold their breath and climb into one of the channels to go up or down levels of the Depths. If they use an elevator they pop out in a newly generated room that is connected to a previously explored room. If they go to an otherwise unexplored floor, just generate a room as normal. Either way the generated rooms have an extra exit that is the elevator.

            This room has a yawning abyss in the center that separates a 5ft ledge that you now find yourselves on. Kelp and Tangle Weed grow off of the sides of the walls of the abyss and tickle the edge with their long leaves. The remains of a bridge reaches 10ft out into the abyss, but the majority of the bridge has fallen. You can see where the bridge used to connect on the far side. In an alcove, on the side of the abyss you are on, sits a massive statue depicting a mighty older man wearing animal furs, bent over, weeping into his hands. Water pours from his eye sockets and pools in his cupped hands. Across the room is a statue of a woman holding a small bundle wrapped in seaweed up to her chest. She similarly has water running down her face, but it pools onto the floor and runs into the abyss.

            *There is a third exit on the other side of the abyss hidden behind a mat of seaweed growing on the wall.

            There are two exits on the Heirs side of the room, both on the same outcropping.

            If the Heirs wash their face in the tears of the male statue, they can see a path across the abyss. It twists and undulates but provides solid footing.

            If the Heirs investigate the bundle in the arms of the female statue, they find a locked chest. Inside is the Green Prince’s Axe.

On the back wall of the temple is a carving in heartwood of a woman wearing a crown similar to the one you carry. The woman’s arms are outstretched in a hug as she leans toward the young boy in front of you.

            This temple was once the home of the Green Prince. The Deep Queen doesn't want the Heirs here and has some of her most dangerous creations guarding this place.

A creature needs to hold their breath and climb into one of the channels to go up or down levels of the Depths. If they use an elevator they pop out in a newly generated room that is connected to a previously explored room. If they go to an otherwise unexplored floor, just generate a room as normal. Either way the generated rooms have an extra exit that is the elevator.

            A school of barreleye swim through the air, floating in and out of an alcove high above the ground. Most have opaque heads but a couple have transparent heads. The barreleye quickly swallow any small creatures or food that they see, chasing small shrimp. A fountain stands in the corner of the room, the bowl of the fountain has a large whale swimming along the rim, then continuously smaller whales circle the rim until they meet up with the large original whale.

            The barreleye are voracious and attempt to eat any food or creatures small enough to swallow.

            If the Heirs spend an Exploration Turn investigating, they notice whatever creatures rolled up on the Encounter Roll are tiny; no more than the size of a walnut. The barreleye voraciously pursue these tiny creatures. One creature should be eaten and seen floating in the head of the transparent barreleye. The creature appears to be directing the barreleye by hitting certain nerves.

            If the Heirs drink from the fountain they shrink down to walnut size. Barreleye will attempt to swallow them. The other Heirs may attempt to fend off the opaque barreleye, but if the shrunken Heir is swallowed by an opaque barreleye they must succeed on a STR Save or die. If they are swallowed by a transparent barreleye, they can direct the fish up towards an alcove that holds treasure. Roll on the Treasure Table. Any Heirs swallowed by the transparent barreleye can find their way to the mouth of the barreleye and escape easily.

            You hear water rushing as you enter this room. A lot of the channels from this floor make their way here, either along the halls or through the small pipes in the walls. The water starts shallow around the edge and gradually gets deeper as you near the center of the spherical room.

            Heirs need to make a STR or DEX Save to stay on their feet at the end of each Combat and Exploration Turn. If they fail, they fall to the ground and begin getting pulled to the center of the room. While knocked prone they are pulled towards the center of the spherical room at the end of their Combat turn.

            At the beginning of a creature’s Combat turn, they may make a STR or DEX Save, if they succeed they are able to stand.

            If they fail two Saves in a row they reach the center of the circle. They are sucked into the channel at the bottom, take 1D6 Bludgeoning Damage, and are spit out into The Kelp Forest (generate a room in the Kelp Forest as usual).

          The many passages of the Twilight are replaced with one narrow, winding path that is the Trench. This is the deepest part of the Temple. It is pitch black and filled with toxic gas, boiling water, and volcanic vents, but somewhere down here is the Deep Queen’s Throne Room. Many creatures congregate around the vents that frequent this depth and feed off of the minerals, chemicals, and heat coming out of them. The walls here look like they are made of flowing liquid stone that was frozen in place.

          Special Rules:
          The Trench is a series of tight tunnels. Instead of the standard circular/square shaped rooms of the floors above the Trench’s rooms are all made up of a serpentine ravine twisting in on itself. It takes an extra Exploration Turn to travel out of any room in the Trench.

          The Deep Queen’s Throne Room is the final room on this floor. When generating the Trench, treat the Throne Room as you would the exit for previous floors.

            A gigantic Squid lunges towards the party. It’s tentacles spread out in an attack display. Water pours forth from its beak like a large waterfall and into a series of channels in the floor. Thankfully it is just a statue, sticking out of a wall. Floating in the pooled water, at the base of the statue, and strewn across the room are ten barrels.

            This massive statue of a Squid is actually a non-functioning water wheel. Each of its huge tentacles has a hook attached to the end, intended to attach to one of the barrels. If all of the barrels are attached to the tentacles the whole head of the squid begins to rotate. This causes a secret passageway behind the waterfall to open up, revealing a chest. Roll on the Treasure Table.

            If the Heirs search the room they may notice a valve that controls the minerals that are spewed out by the smokers. It is currently twisted to the right. If it is twisted to the left the steam gets lighter and cooler. In the middle is the perfect mixture.

      description: |-
        This room has a pattern of channels on the floor. It looks like a grid of 5ft diameter circles that stretches across the room. Each one has water circling it and spiraling down into some strange circular bowl. Some of the bowls occasionally fall away on a hinge and dump the water below you.

        Trap: This room is covered in a pattern of pits. It's a sort of drain. It's like a checkerboard, but every square is a circle, and all of the black squares are hinged trapdoors. Each bowl holds up to 5 gallons of water. Once it exceeds that amount the bowl gives out and spills its contents into whatever is below.

        There are three default ways for Heirs to navigate this trap. Feel free to deviate from these if your Heirs come-up with a more unique way:

        A. They take it slow. The Heirs move at half speed but don't have to make any saves. This method assumes they know about the trap or at least suspect something.

        B. They walk through normally. This is the most common choice if the Heirs are unaware of the trap. In order to cross the room, the Heirs must make a DEX Save. If they are unaware of the trap they have [-] on the Save.

        C. They rush through. The Heirs are running through the room. They must make a DEX Save [-] if they are aware of the trap and [--] if they are unaware.

        Trap Effects by Floor:

        Pelagic: The pits connect to current channels that lead down to the floor below. Any Heir that falls within is spat out into a randomly generated room on the Reef level.

        Reef: The pits once connected to current channels that lead down to the floor below. A colony of Pike Coral now calls these tubes home. Treat these channels like pit traps. Any creature that falls into them takes 1D6 Piercing Damage.

        Kelp Forest: The pits once connected to current channels that lead down to the floor below. A bunch of Tangle Weed now grows in the tubes. Any creature that falls into the pits gets caught in the middle of the tube in a mess of Tangle Weed. It requires a DEX or STR Save to untangle yourself. Then you fall to the floor below or can attempt to climb out.

        Twilight: The pits connect to current channels that lead down to the floor below. Any Heir that falls within is spat out into a randomly generated room on the Trench.

        Trench: The pits connect to hydrothermal vents. Any Heir that fails the DEX Save takes 2D6 Heat Damage.

      - name: An Anchor With An Unusually Long Shank
        description: |-
          You could give something a good whack with it.

          Arcane Study: The Anchor of Ataahua
          Damage: 1D10 | Hand: 2 | Quality: 5 | Slot: 3 | The wielder is not affected by involuntary movement.

          This large anchor-like war pick was wielded by Ataahua. She was a famous Sailor (if any Heirs are Sailors she can be one of their ancestors, forgotten to the ravages of time) and the first to find another island after the Great Flood. From the bow of a pirate vessel, the anchor was hewn and used to send its previous owners to the embrace of the Deep Queen.
      - name: A Vibrantly Colored Conch
        description: |-
          It whispers stories when held up to a person's ear. The conch tells a different tale every day. Tales are at the discretion of the GM. Use this item as a way to build out the myth of the Deep Queen’s Temple, build up stories from past generations of Heirs, or just add your own flair.

          Arcane Study 1: Wilhelm's Shell
          This shell once was the home of a sentient conch by the name of Wilhelm. Wilhelm travelled the three currents to collect tales from all. Their spirit was bound to their shell by their desire to share their collected tales. Now anyone who holds the shell to their ear can listen to one of Wilhelm's tales. There may be more to learn here...

          Arcane Study 2:
          Wilhelm was so driven and empathetic towards their stories that they began to act out the parts in the tales.

          If you ask Wilhelm nicely (by succeeding on a CHA Save) Wilhelm will come out of their shell as a character from one of their tales. They will obey any command that you ask of them.

      - name: A Horn Made Of Tarnished Brass That Has The Image Of A Lighthouse Inscribed On It
        description: |-

          Arcane Study: Fetu’s Foghorn
          Once per Rest you may spend an Action blowing the horn to create thick fog in the room you are in. It gives any creature that relies on sight [-] on Attack rolls and Saves that rely on sight.

          Fetu was the keeper of a lighthouse on a distant island. On especially foggy nights they would blow their horn to warn passing ships of the peninsula the lighthouse set on. Until one foggy night when they chose not to.
      - name: A Large Crab's Claw That Has Been Strung With A Fine Thread
        description: |-
          It makes a haunting melody when played like a fiddle.

          Arcane Study: The Fiddler’s Claw
          Gives [+] on any checks involving the instrument. | You may play a song on the Fiddler’s Claw to attempt to cast Charm on any crustacean.

          A claw of a crustacean musician. Famed for their skill and known to draw crowds of crabs from miles around. So frustrated was the original fiddler by the lack of proper musical instruments that they removed their own claw and created a perfect fiddle out of it.
      - name: It Looks Somewhat Like An Ornate Brass Astrolabe
        description: |-
          The face is covered in a grid of circles laid out like a cylinder that changes in diameter. You can spin each circle independently.

          Arcane Study: Mereana’s Trench Navigator
          Once per Rest you may make a WIS Save to give the GM [+] or [-] on a room generation check. This ability stacks with other similar abilities.

          One of the first explorers of the Deep Queen’s Temple, Mereana made it her life’s work to chart its infinite halls. She discovered the location of the Deep Queen’s Throne and attempted to get the Crown to return it. However, she wasn’t a member of one of the founding families and they refused to risk the Crown in the hands of an outsider. In her frustration Mereana threw the navigator into the depths and sailed away from Manawa, never to be seen again.
      - name: A Large Two-Handed, Tree Felling Axe
        description: |-
          It is covered in rust, but it still feels sharp and strong. The shaft appears to have grown around the blade naturally.

          Arcane Study: The Green Prince’s Ax
          Damage: 1D10 [+] | Hand: 2 | Quality: 5 | Slot: 3 | The ax regenerates 1 Quality per Rest. | You may cast Thicket once per Rest.

          You see a sapling. Small and weak. It reaches for the sun in a dense forest, but it’s too small and can’t reach it. Suddenly a shadow passes over and a small smiling face looks down at it. The face looks up at the branches above and frowns. You see the small child climb the nearby trees and prune the branches so the sapling can grow. Then the child returns to the sapling and whispers to it. The sapling perks up and embraces the piece of old iron that the child offers it. Forever grateful, it never left the child’s side. Not even when the water came and took the child. Not until now.
      - name: A Massive Maul Made Of Granite
        description: |-
          On it is an imprint of an old man’s face. It is craggy and filled with deep powerful ridges.

          Arcane Study: Elcontra’s Hammer
          Damage: 1D10 [+] | Hand: 2 | Quality: 5 | Slot: 3 | Deals double damage to structure and constructs. | You may cast Shape Elements once per Rest.

          A massive man is sitting bent over a potter’s wheel. He begins to spin it and as the revolutions begin to slow you see a newly formed mountain. It towers as he places it with the others. He shrinks down and sits atop the mountain. He chuckles with a great laugh and then looks to see a blemish in the mountain, a piece of granite is ticking up in an unsightly way. Tutting, the giant walks over to the blemish and wrenches it free with one mighty tug. Then he sets it down and looks at it. A mischievous grin spreads across his face and he slowly massages the boulder until it is pliable like clay. Then he smashes his face into it. When he pulls his face back he sees his imprint and guffaws. He sticks a large stout pine into the base of the boulder and slings it across his shoulder, carrying it on his travels.
      - name: A Scythe That's Blade Is Mostly Transparent
        description: |-
          It shifts ever so slightly.

          Arcane Study: Foltoran’s Scythe
          Damage: 1D8 [+] | Hand: 2 | Quality: 5 | Slot: 3 | If you kill a creature with the scythe you may immediately make an additional Attack versus another adjacent creature. | You may cast Gust twice per Rest.

          A gentle looking man looks out over a massive field. The grass and grain shifts in the wind. The man ponders this and begins to mimic the patterns of the winds with his hands. Then in his hands the wind begins to solidify into a blade. The man stops and ponders the blade, pricks his finger and winces. Nods approvingly and then connects the blade to a bamboo shaft. He then begins to harvest and tend to the grains.
      - name: A Pick With A Translucent Head
        description: |-
          It sweats beads of water and is as cold as ice.

          Arcane Study: Frigil’s Pick
          Damage: 1D6 [+] | Hand: 1 | Quality: 5 | Slot: 2 | The magical ice of this pick allows you to ignore two points of AD on targets you Attack with the pick. | You may cast Icy Touch twice per Rest.

          A woman walks through a series of ice caves. The caves glow a deep blue and her face looks at peace. Her eyes pass over a series of icicles, and they stop on the last one. The next thing you see is her hand reach up and snap off the icicle. Sculpting it slowly, she creates a slight curve to the spike and smoothes it. She then finds another longer icicle and she melts the two together. Then she takes an animal skin out of her pack and wraps the handle with it to keep her hand warm.
      - name: A Shovel With A Head Made of Glass
        description: |-
          The handle is made of blackened charred wood.

          Arcane Study: The Yellow Princess’ Shovel
          Damage: 1D8 [+] | Hand: 2 | Quality: 5 | Slot: 3 | You may spend an action whipping up a dust devil to obscure you for one turn, it gives [-] to any creatures trying to Attack you. | You may cast Marble Madness twice per Rest.

          A teenager sprints as fast as the wind across countless dunes, occasionally skipping from one dune to the next, their lithe form hardly disturbing the sand. They skid to a stop in front of a scorched area with a blackened tree in the center. They circle it curiously, then approach carefully and grab hold of the tree. Giving it a wiggle, you hear cracking. They stomp the ground a few times then give the tree a solid tug. Out comes the shovel you now hold in their hands. They smile and twirl the shovel around themselves sending grains of sand spiraling out.
      - name: A Harpoon, The Point Appears To Be Made Of Volcanic Rock And Is Split Down The Middle
        description: |-
          One side is freezing to the touch and the other blistering.

          Arcane Study: The Deep Queen’s Harpoon
          Damage: 1D12 [+] | Hand: 2 | Quality: 5 | Slot: 3 | Anytime you Attack with the harpoon you may choose to do 1D4 additional damage that is either Cold or Heat damage. | You may cast Boiling Blast twice per rest.

          A woman in a crown watches strange creatures swimming in a primordial sea. The beasts squirm and writhe as you watch. Then the sun begins to move quicker overhead and it keeps accelerating until it is blurring across the sky. The creatures rapidly change until you see one climb out onto the shore of the sea and take its first clumsy steps on the sandy beach. The woman smiles. Time moves onward until you see people pushing primitive canoes out into the ocean and begin to fish. The woman smiles and sends fish and squid up their nets. Time moves on, the woman gives birth to a small child, green, with a crown of twigs. The woman hugs the child sweetly. Time continues and she sends the child up onto land to create their own space. Onward the sun moves and you see her find her crown missing. She clenches the harpoon with frustration and looks out to the land. The sun flickers forward for a moment, and next you see she is clenching the harpoon tighter than you believed possible. In her other hand is a crown of twigs. It is water-logged. She sobs and the harpoon does as well.
